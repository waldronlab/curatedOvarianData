curatedOvarianData is a comprehensive resource for clinically-oriented
investigation of the ovarian cancer transcriptome.  It provides
clinically-annotated expression data for 2,970 patients as 24
expression datasets including The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) microRNA
and Affymetrix mRNA microarray datasets.  Probesets are mapped to
official gene symbols using up-to-date maps.  All clinical annotations
are hand-curated and machine-checked to ensure consistent syntax and
maximum retention of available clinical variables, resulting in nearly
1,500 patients in which overall survival, stage, grade and histology
are available.  ExpressionSet slots are populated with numerous
metadata including PubMed IDs, citations, abstracts, study-specific
warnings for retractions and duplicated samples, and probeset <-->
gene maps.  The package vignette provides examples for selecting
patients and datasets based on flexible rules, performing
meta-analysis of potential biomarkers, creating publication-ready
tables from ExpressionSet metadata, and simple exporting of data
tables for non R-users.
